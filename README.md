# **MangaHelp** (manga.help)

**Discover manga through meaning, not keywords**

An open-source manga discovery engine built on semantic search that converts natural language queries into vector embeddings, matching them against the Jikan API's rich metadata including synopses, genres, themes, demographics, and background information. Instead of literal keyword matching, MangaHelp understands conceptual relationships between manga, allowing you to search for "psychological thriller with unreliable narrator" or "romance with time travel elements" and receive results based on actual thematic similarity rather than term frequency. For users who want personalized recommendations, optional integration with AniList or MAL lists refines results based on your reading history, but the core semantic search functions as a standalone discovery tool that augments rather than replaces existing tracking platforms.
